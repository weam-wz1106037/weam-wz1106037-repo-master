    <h2>My Experience in Qatar University and Arabic Program!</h2>
    <p>

        I have been studying abroad since long time now, in several countries and great universities, but I am
        completely enthusiastic about the outcome. The teaching quality is highly efficient and professional,
        the
        best I
        have ever seen for teaching a language at the university, partly because is concentrated partly because
        the
        professors are highly prepared, passionate and energetic. The program is intensive and challenging, you
        need
        to
        struggle a lot to catch up if you are a beginner but after the initial frustration there is indeed a
        very
        positive feeling in progressing so fast and such in a short period. The satisfaction you have from being
        in
        the
        program is the best part for me, but at the same time, living in Doha has turned out to be a complete
        new
        and
        nice experience. My colleagues among the international students are interesting, with a rich personal
        and
        academic background, and everyone contributes in being part of an environment which is at the same time
        stimulating and friendly.</p>
